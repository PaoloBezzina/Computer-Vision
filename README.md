# ARI2129: Principles of Computer Vision for AI - Assignment

The aim of this project is to provide an opportunity to implement a selection of
computer vision techniques that can serve as a foundation for more complex applications
and their evaluation. Packaged OpenCV functions as well as self implemented implement
ones were used.

For this Project, the COTS dataset was used, available for free through the website (www.cotsdataset.info).
The COTS dataset presents scenes with an incremental nature.

The first part of this project tackles the problem of content blending across differentimages.

In the second part of this project, several inpainting techniques were covered together with their evaluation.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8.8
* IPython 7.22.0
* jupyter_client 6.1.12
* jupyter_core 4.7.1
* jupyterlab 3.0.14
* notebook 6.3.0

### Installing

To install all above libraries at one go
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program
Since both Tasks are in a '.ipynb' format, in order to run they should be opened from any notebook editor however Jupyter is recomended
